# Automated Helmet Detection Using CNNs

## Real-World Problem

Construction and industrial sites have a high risk of head injuries. Workers must wear safety helmets, but monitoring large sites manually is inefficient and inconsistent.

## Project Goal

Use a computer vision system that detects whether a person in an image is **wearing a helmet** or **not wearing a helmet**, automatically and in real-time.

## Dataset

Binary images organized into:
- Train/Helmet
- Train/NoHelmet
- Test/Helmet
- Test/NoHelmet

Images were resized to 224×224 and normalized before training.

## Why This Matters

- Improves onsite safety
- Reduces compliance violations
- Supports automated enforcement
- Can be used with existing camera systems
